        <p>
          A website (also written as a web site) is a collection of web pages
          and related content that is identified by a common domain name and
          published on at least one web server. Examples of notable websites are
          Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Wikipedia. All publicly accessible
          websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web. There are also
          private websites that can only be accessed on a private network, such
          as a company's internal website for its employees. Websites are
          typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news,
          education, commerce, entertainment, or social networking. Hyperlinking
          between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often
          starts with a home page. Users can access websites on a range of
          devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The
          app used on these devices is called a web browser.

      <h1>Hacking</h1>
      <p>
        Hacking refers to activities that seek to compromise digital devices,
        such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and even entire networks. And
        while hacking might not always be for malicious purposes, nowadays most
        references to hacking, and hackers, characterize it/them as unlawful
        activity by cybercriminals—motivated by financial gain, protest,
        information gathering (spying), and even just for the “fun” of the
        challenge.
